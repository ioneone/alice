Alice is my artificial virtual assistant.

## How It Works

Alice is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Every morning, [Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) executes:

```bash
python main.py
```

to perform the tasks.

## What She Does

Here's the list of things she does for me:

### Rain Alert ðŸŒ§

Every morning, she checks if it will rain today in Los Angeles, and reminds me to bring an umbrella if it does.

- [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

### S&P 500 Tracker ðŸ’¹

Every morning, she tells me how much the price of S&P 500 has increased or decreased since last week.

- [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/)
