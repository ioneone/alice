Alice is my artificial virtual assistant.

## How It Works

Alice is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Every morning, [Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) executes:

```bash
python main.py
```

to perform the tasks I tell her to do.

## What She Does

Here's the list of things she does for me:

### Rain Alert ðŸŒ§

Every morning, she checks if it will rain today in Los Angeles, and reminds me to bring an umbrella if it does.
